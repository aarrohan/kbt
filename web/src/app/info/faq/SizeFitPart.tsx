      question: "How do I determine the right size for me?",
      answer:
        "To determine the right size, refer to the size chart provided on the product page. Measure your bust, waist, and hips using a flexible measuring tape and compare your measurements to the chart. If you're between sizes, we recommend choosing the larger size for a more comfortable fit.",

        "Our sizes are designed to be true to fit, but it can vary depending on the brand and style. We recommend reading customer reviews and checking the product description for any specific sizing advice. If youâ€™re unsure, our customer service team is here to help with any specific questions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if I'm in between sizes?",
